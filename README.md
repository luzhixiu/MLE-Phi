# MLE-Phi
This repository includes the methods and data needed to calculate MLE-phi for several most studied model organisms, MLE-Phi can be used to estimate global and local translation rate of given protein coding sequence.

File Descriptions:

Mutation files includes the measured mutation bias for a given codon in the organism, namly Delta M.
Selection files includes the measured selection factor for a given codon in the organism, namly Delta Eta.
